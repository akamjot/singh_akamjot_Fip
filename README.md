# singh_akamjot_Fip
In this Fip i am going to create to mobile web pages along with the css style. So yeah lets get started.

Hi sir,
I am Akamjot Singh.
In this file i have created 3 mobile pages of the Couple resort website which are Homepage, Dining page, Spa page.
In homepage have created some effects using after pseudo element on the checkbox.
Apart from the After pseudo element i have also created simple css animation for submit button.

This whole process of creating this file took me 9 days in which their were so many ups and down 
First, i created 3 different css for 3 html pages then one of my classmate told me that we have to create only one css so i merged all of them and i know how difficult it is. I think creating css is way easy then merging them.

I have done everything i could and i hope i meet all your expectations.
Thank you,
Have a nice holidays.
