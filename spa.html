                <p>Touching is healing; from a mother's touch which comforts and soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete patted on the back by fellow athletes. Based on the same principle as human touch, massage is the oldest method of promoting good health, suppleness and strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the general public and other health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative. Due to public perception and desire, massage therapy has grown into a more prominent position. It is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not only for your physical but emotional well being also. Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation, the skilled use of massage through touch is used to maintain and enhance the health and well being of the entire body. Experience the benefits massage can offer you. </p>

                    <p>Experience the ultimate in relaxation. Stone massage involves the application of heated stones to key points on the body, allowing an intense penetrating heat which eases muscle aches, improves circulation, relieves back pain, and reduces stress. The warmth of the stones promotes deep healing by expanding the blood vessels and relaxing the nervous system, alleviating symptoms of insomnia and arthritic conditions while melting away the tension and stresses of daily life. This unique indulgence is not to be missed! </p>
